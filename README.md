# netprint

A pretty-printer for network requests.

## To Do

* Nice colorized printing
* `-tcp`, for printing raw TCP requests
* `-udp`, for printing raw UDP packets
* `-v`, verbose mode -- when serving HTTP, print everything in the request (headers, etc).
* Pretty-print json (if valid)
* `-x` for hex dumping the result instead of printing directly. Also hex-dump automatically if the result is a
  binary mime type.
